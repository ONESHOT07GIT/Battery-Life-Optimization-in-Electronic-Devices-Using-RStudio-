### Problem Statement

Due to our frequent use of laptops for various activities, including data science projects and everyday tasks, we have noted significant variations in battery performance. This frequently results in disruptions to our workflow, particularly during travel or when away from a power source. We considered identifying the factors that significantly influence battery life, which we can modify to extend the longevity of my batteries. As we  suspected that certain factors like the display refresh rate, brightness levels, sound settings, and screen resolution might be playing a significant role in draining the battery. However, we don't have clear data to confirm how much each factor contributes to the issue.

### Significance of Battery Life

Understanding battery life is important as it directly affects user experience, productivity, and device portability, influencing consumer choices and technological advancements in energy efficiency.

### Motivation for the Project

We want to maximize our screen on time on battery on a single charge. The fast battery drain of high-performance laptops, especially gaming laptops, is a common frustration among users. Gaming laptops, designed to handle high processing demands, tend to discharge rapidly due to resource-heavy tasks such as rendering high-resolution graphics or running at high refresh rates. This issue becomes more pronounced when the laptop is used in performance modes, with high brightness, refresh rate, and speaker volume. The motivation for this project is to understand and analyze the factors contributing to rapid battery discharge in laptops and provide insights on optimizing battery life by adjusting specific parameters such as refresh rate, brightness, and resolution.
