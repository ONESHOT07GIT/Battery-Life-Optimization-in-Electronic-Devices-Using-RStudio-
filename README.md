# Device-Battery-Life-Optimization-Analysis

This project involves an extensive analysis of battery life in electronic devices using  **RStudio** . Statistical methodologies such as **ANOVA** and **regression** were employed to evaluate the impact of various factors, including  **refresh rate** ,  **brightness** ,  **resolution** , and other performance-affecting variables. The result is a versatile framework aimed at optimizing battery performance across a range of devices.
